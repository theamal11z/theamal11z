# 🚀 Mohsin Raja — Innovator | Developer | Neuro-Tech Aspirant  
🇳🇵 Birgunj, Nepal | 17 y/o | Bio-Math Student | Self-Taught Technologist  

I build systems that merge **emotion, intelligence, and technology**.  
My work spans neuroengineering concepts, AI-driven tools, community platforms, and experimental digital experiences that aim to **amplify human potential**—not replace it.

I think like a scientist, create like an artist, analyze like a psychologist, and build like an engineer.  
My long-term aspiration is to contribute to the next phase of **post-human evolution**.
