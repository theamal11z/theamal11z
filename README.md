# Mohsin Raja // **Neuro-Tech** & **Human Systems**
> **Innovator | 17 y/o | Birgunj, Nepal**

I operate at the convergence of **Technology, Cognition, and Behavior**. My focus is on engineering systems that augment human capability—specifically in self-understanding, efficient learning, and purposeful connection. Long-term, I target human augmentation and the extension of cognitive interfaces.

## ⚡ Current System Focus

Deep work on high-leverage domains:

* **Cognitive Augmentation:** AI systems engineered for superior productivity and study (clarity over distraction).
* **Neuro-Interfaces:** Conceptualizing and developing non-invasive neuroengineering solutions.
* **Behavioral Telemetry:** Building tools for digital autonomy and advanced analytics of interaction patterns.
* **Psychological Design:** Crafting interfaces where emotional and behavioral principles drive function.
* **Impact-Driven Platforms:** Community tools addressing tangible, real-world constraints.
